# firefox extension to download links

It is simple Firefox extensions to get links from all `<img>` and `<a>` on active page, 
filter them by extensions `jpg|png|wmv|mpg|mpeg|mp4` 
and download them to folder `~/xxx/{date}/{number}/`. 

It increases `{number}` before every download so every download is in separated folder.
